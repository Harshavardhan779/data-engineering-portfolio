# Sales Data Analysis Pipeline

## My First Data Engineering Project

### Overview
This is my first complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline project.

### What It Does
1. **Extracts** data from CSV file
2. **Transforms** data by calculating revenue
3. **Analyzes** sales patterns and generates insights
4. **Loads** results into a summary CSV file

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- CSV files

### Key Insights Generated
- Total revenue across all sales
- Top 5 products by revenue
- Revenue breakdown by city
- Average transaction value
- Best selling product by quantity

### Files in This Project
- `sales_data.csv` - Input data (10 transactions)
- `sales_analysis.py` - Main pipeline code
- `sales_summary.csv` - Output summary (generated)
- `README.md` - This documentation

### How to Run
```bash
python sales_analysis.py
```

### What I Learned
- Building ETL pipelines from scratch
- Using Pandas for data transformation
- Grouping and aggregating data
- Generating business insights from raw data
- Professional code documentation
